originally the hvac has three temp sensors it uses to regulate itself
return, duct and ambient
in the simulator the return is independant and the duct and ambient is combined
the duct and ambient combined changes its resistance range for the simulator box

during a PM and diagnosis we use a box and a couple of potentiometers to simulate a variety of temps to force the unit into the modes and to switch between modes.

we use one sensor for all three inputs.
its specs are
5 kOhm at 110 degrees
27.6 kOhm 32 degrees
7.5 kOhm 90 Degrees

the simulator box needs/uses the following

RETURN sensor
111.9*f @ 4.8kOhm
65*f @ 13kOhm
32*f @ 29.16kOhm

so range of 25kOhm from 5kOhm to 30kOhm
low spec=5 kOhm
high spec=30 kOhm
range=25 kOhm

DUCT and AMBIENT

2.8kOhm @ 103.4*f
20.3kOhm @ 19.4*f

so range of 18kOhm from 2.8kOhm to 20.3kOhm

low spec=3kOhm
high sped=20kOhm
range=17kOhm
